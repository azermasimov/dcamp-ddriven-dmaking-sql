# Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL

In this course, I learned how to use SQL to support decision making. It was based on a case study about an online movie rental company with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more. I learned to apply SQL queries to study for example customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development. This course also covered SQL extensions for online analytical processing (OLAP), which made it easier to obtain key insights from multidimensional aggregated data.
